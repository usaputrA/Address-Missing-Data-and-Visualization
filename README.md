# Address-Missing-Data-and-Visualization
We want to explore potential business opportunities, specifically to analyze and identify existing companies that have a valuation exceeding $1 billion. These highly successful businesses are commonly known as "unicorns." By compiling this list, we aim to assist our client in gaining insights into profitable business models and investment opportunities.

However, we're more interested to learn how hardware and AI business is going on around the world. Here's the outline for our further analysis: 
- Companies in the `hardware` industry based in `Beijing`, `San Francisco`, and `London` 
- Companies in the `artificial intelligence` industry based in `San Francisco`
-  A list of the top 20 countries sorted by sum of company valuations in each country, excluding `United States`, `China`, `India`, and `United Kingdom`
- A global valuation map of all countries
- A global valuation map of all countries except `United States`, `China`, `India`, and `United Kingdom`

Our dataset includes a list of businesses and data points, such as the year they were founded; their industry; and their city, country, and continent.
